Hey, thanks for visiting my page! :sparkles:

I am a Master's student studying Computer Science at Washington University in St. Louis. My research interests revolve around the field of **Trustworthy AI**, where I explore the possibilities of fundamentally understanding and certifying deep machine learning models. I'm driven by the potential to create AI systems that are reliable, transparent, and aligned with human values.

Currently, I am working on my Master's thesis under the supervision of Dr. [Yevgeniy Vorobeychik](https://vorobeychik.com/) where we try to develop a framework for obtaining and formally verifying safety guarantees in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. 

Additionally, I am a founding member of [WrapperAI](https://wrapperai.org/), a startup that leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and information theory to develop solutions for safeguarding user privacy in scenarios such as digital file storage and user interactions with chatbots. 

In my free time, I enjoy watching Netflix, playing video games (fingers crossed that Blizzard can revive World of Warcraft :broken_heart:), going on hikes with friends, and photography.
